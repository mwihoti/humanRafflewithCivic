## üì± Key Features and Flows

### Raffle Entry Process

The raffle entry process is a core feature of the platform:

1. **Authentication**: Users sign in with Civic Auth to verify they are human
2. **Wallet Creation**: A Civic embedded wallet is automatically created during the sign-in process 
3. **Raffle Selection**: Users browse and select a raffle they want to enter
4. **Payment**: Users make an ETH payment to enter the raffle
   - Minimum entry amount is 0.001 ETH
   - Larger contributions may increase winning chances (if enabled)
5. **Confirmation**: After payment confirmation, the user receives an NFT ticket
6. **Winner Selection**: When the raffle ends, a winner is randomly selected



### Payment Flow

The payment flow uses wagmi hooks to interact with the Ethereum blockchain:

1. User clicks "Enter Raffle" button
2. Payment dialog opens with configurable ETH amount
3. User confirms payment, triggering an Ethereum transaction
4. Application monitors transaction status
5. On successful confirmation, the user's entry is recorded
6. User receives an NFT ticket and confetti celebration

### Wallet Integration

The platform exclusively uses Civic's embedded wallet:

- **Automatic Wallet Creation**: Wallet is automatically created when users sign in with Civic Auth
- **No External Wallets**: Users don't need to connect external wallets like MetaMask
- **Seamless Experience**: The wallet creation process is handled behind the scenes

The wallet component displays:
- Connection status
- Wallet address (shortened with copy option)
- ETH balance with low balance warning


## üîÑ Civic Auth Integration

HumanRaffle uses Civic Auth for:

1. **Human Verification**: Ensuring participants are real people
2. **Wallet Creation**: Helping users without wallets create one
3. **Secure Authentication**: Providing a secure login experience

The integration is handled through:
- `useUser` hook from `@civic/auth-web3/react`
- `userHasWallet` utility from `@civic/auth-web3`
- Automatic wallet creation during authentication
